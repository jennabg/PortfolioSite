    Humbie Helper was built for students by students who wanted a better way to virtually
    collaborate on projects. Humbie is a helpful tool for anyone who is part of a team
    and wants a better way to share notes, ask questions and communicate with their team
    members more effectively and efficiently.

    <h2>Site Design</h2>
    <p>

    The website has a large range of features that needed to be displayed in an easy and accessible
    way to its users. The project incorporates bootstrap to help simplify the design and make
    use of the bootstrap tab and modal features as a way to organize data and features within
    the project.

    <h2>Feature Development</h2>
    <p>
      For this project I was tasked with developing the Project feature, the Notes feature and the FAQ
      feature. Each of these features presented a unique set of challenges. The main challenge for the Project
      feature was figuring out how to add multiple students to a project at once without adding duplicates.
      For the FAQ feature it was deciding on the best and most efficient way to display the data to our
      users and for the Notes feature it was creating a dynamic notes tool that would give our users all
        the options they needed. You can see how I solved these problems in the
