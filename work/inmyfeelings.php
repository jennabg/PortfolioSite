    This site was a school project based on using APIs. The task was to create a
    website that integrated two different APIs together. My concept was to create a
    site that recommends both a book and a movie based on user input of how they are
    feeling.

    <h2>Site Design</h2>
    <p>
    Since the concept for the site is kind of playful and interactive I wanted the
    design to mimic that sentiment. I used a bright colour palette and bold font to lend a
    fun and upbeat vibe to the site. The design of the site is minimal in order to
    let the content and interaction with the APIs be more of a focal point.

    <h2>APIs</h2>
    <p>
    As the main purpose of the project was to interact with APIs I wanted to
    highlight the two APIs that were integrated into the project and show the AJAX
    calls that display the content. This can be seen in the screenshot of the code below.
