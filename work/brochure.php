    <p>
      As Ve’ahavta’s organization grew in size, they needed a way to market each individual program
      while still keeping them under the Ve’ahavta umbrella. I developed a set of brochures that worked
      within the organization’s brand guidelines and could be given out as a package or as stand alone pieces.
      Each brochure follows the same basic layout and contains
      the same information about the organization while the colour, images and content within differ from piece
      to piece.
