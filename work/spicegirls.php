    Tasked with creating a restaurant website for a school project,
    our team decided to create the Spice Girls restaurant and use the
    idea of bold and bright flavours to create a bold and bright website.

    <h2>Site Design</h2>
    <p>
    As the lead designer for the site I had to create the brand from scratch.
    I drew inspiration from peppers both for their spicy flavours and
    colourful palette to design the logo and branding for the restaurant.
    The vivid colours and bold typography give the website an eye-catching
    look and give users a taste of what they could expect from the actual
    restaurant. Along with creating the branding and styling the entire site, I
    also created custom assests for the website to help develop a cohesive brand.
    These assests included creating items like the gift cards and icons for the game.

    <h2>Homepage Design</h2>
    <p>
    For the landing page, I wanted to ensure the bold branding
    really set the stage for the user experience of the site.  Building off
    of the brand to include text and photography that fell within the brand
    parameters really helped to elevate the idea of the website and push
    the “Spice Girls” experience even further. The homepage highlights not
    only the look and feel of the website, but helps users navigate to the
     most frequently visited pages of the website.
     <br />The homepage features javascript that toggles between classes to help
     show and hide the transparcency of the images as well as the button
     overlays. The homepage also introduces a banner menu that becomes replaced
     by a sticky top menu as the user begins to scroll, also implemented with
     javascript.
