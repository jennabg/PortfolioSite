    <h1> Portfolio Show Invitation </h1>

    <p>
    When asked to create the invitation for the Humber College Web Development Portfolio Show, I jumped
    at the opportunity to combine my two passions into one project. I wanted to use my graphic design
    skills in a way that highlighted the beauty of coding and brought to life some of the tools that began
    to feel like a second skin during the course of the program. The final result mimicked the look and
    feel of an IDE in order to display the information in a way that would be both visually appealing and
    familiar to event attendees.
